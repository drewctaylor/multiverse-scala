==========

Where `story.multiverse` is a Multiverse source file.

Writing Multiverse
------------------

To write Multiverse, you may use any text editor.  We recommend the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor, which supports syntax highlighting of Multiverse source through the [multiverse package](https://github.com/drewctaylor/language-multiverse).

The [test](https://github.com/drewctaylor/multiverse/blob/master/src/test/resources/edu/gatech/dt87/multiverse/story/dsl/) directory includes examples of Multiverse source. One example,  [MurderMystery.multiverse](https://github.com/drewctaylor/multiverse/blob/master/src/test/resources/edu/gatech/dt87/multiverse/story/dsl/MurderMystery.multiverse), is a conversion of a similar example from the [Wide Ruled system](http://skorupski.org/wiki/wide_ruled/wide_ruled_v2).
